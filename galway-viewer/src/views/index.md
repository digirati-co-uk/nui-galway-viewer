# NUI Galway Viewer

This work follows the specifications of the [International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)](https://iiif.io/), with a
new and innovative timeline navigation application. The IIIF suite of specifications facilitates interoperability
between applications that serve, display, and manipulate images. IIIF helps further sharing of images between
cultural heritage institutions who provide access to complementary digital resources.

This version of the **Galway Viewer** is a beta version, released **11 October 2017**. Issues can be logged at [GitHub](https://github.com/digirati-co-uk/nui-galway-viewer/issues) or
by contacting the [Digital Publishing and Innovation team](mailto:digitallibrary@nuigalway.ie) at the [NUI Galway Library](https://library.nuigalway.ie).
